# polymer-playground

Code experiments using [Web Components](http://webcomponents.org/) using Google's [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) library. It is both a proof of concept on building entire applications with Polymer and how to integrate third party libraries and applications such as [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) for backend and other work.
